# Semantic Segmentation using SegFormer Transformers

This is example for an Fine-tunning of SegFormer Transformer on Facade Database, where we have train Segformer Encoder-Decoder and also Auxillary Net. These Auxillary Network also train and save embeddings for new data. We have brought decent scores for meanIOU and Losses degrading smoothly. </br>

Below I will paste 2 expirements evaluation :-

a) BCE Loss

b) using CrossEntropy Loss in 2nd Expirement
